Sometimes, when using XAMPP, the seeder does not work; therefore, I prefer to use WAMPSERVER for database migrations. I faced this issue when creating this project.

SETUP

1.composer install
2.npm install
3.npm run dev
4.php artisan migrete:fresh --seed
5.php artisan serve


composer require twilio/sdk
php artisan schedule:run
